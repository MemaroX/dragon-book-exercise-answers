# Chapter 3 Key Points

### 1. Conversion from NFA, DFA to Regular Expressions

http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs373/sp2009/lectures/lect_08.pdf

### 2. KMP and its Extended Algorithms (p87)

Refer to matrix's blog post [A Detailed Explanation of the KMP Algorithm](http://www.matrix67.com/blog/archives/115). The article provides examples, which are relatively easy to understand.

### 3. Efficiency of String Processing Algorithms (p103)

For each constructed DFA state, we must construct at most 4|r| new states.

### 4. Time and Space Trade-offs in DFA Simulation (p116)

The algorithm represented in Figure 3-66.

### 5. Minimising the Number of States in a DFA (p115)

Note line 4 of Figure 3-64: "The transitions for states s and t on input a both lead to the same group in Î ", not to the same state. If the determination is made based on whether they arrive at the same state, then if the transitions of s and t on input a lead to two different but indistinguishable states, s and t would be considered distinguishable.
