# Exercises for Section 5.5

### 5.5.1

Implement each of the SDDs from Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.1.

### 5.5.2

Implement each of the SDDs from Exercise 5.4.4 as a recursive-descent parser in the style of Section 5.5.2.

### 5.5.3

Implement each of the SDDs from Exercise 5.4.4 together with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3. They should generate code while scanning the input.

### 5.5.4

Implement each of the SDDs from Exercise 5.4.4 together with an LL parser in the style of Section 5.5.3, but with the code (or pointers to the code) stored on the stack.

### 5.5.5

Implement each of the SDDs from Exercise 5.4.4 together with an LR parser in the style of Section 5.5.4.

### 5.5.6

Implement the SDD from Exercise 5.2.4 in the style of Section 5.5.1. Is the implementation obtained in the style of Section 5.5.2 different from this implementation?
