# Exercises for Section 6.7

### 6.7.1

Translate the following expressions using the translation scheme in Figure 6-43. Give the `truelist` and `falselist` for each subexpression. You can assume that the address of the first generated instruction is 100.

1. a==b && (c==d || e==f)
2. (a==b || c==d) || e==f
3. (a==b && c==d) && e==f

#### Solution

1. a==b && (c==d || e==f)

### 6.7.2

#### Solution

1. E3.false = i1
2. S2.next = i7
3. E4.false = i7
4. S1.next = i3
5. E2.true = i3

### 6.7.3

When translating Figure 6-47 using the translation scheme in Figure 6-46, we create an S.next list for each statement. It starts with assignment statements S1, S2, S3, and then gradually processes increasingly larger if statements, if-else statements, while statements, and blocks. In Figure 6-47, there are 5 such structured statements:

- S4: while (E3) S1
- S5: if(E4) S2
- S6: block containing S5 and S3
- S7: if(E2) S4 else S6
- S8: entire program

For these structured statements, we can construct Si.next using a rule with other Sj.next lists and the lists Ek.true and Ek.false of expressions in the program. Give the rules for calculating the following next lists:

1. S4.next
2. S5.next
3. S6.next
4. S7.next
5. S8.next

#### Solution

(The answer to this question is not very certain)

1. S4.next = S3.next
2. S5.next = S2.next
3. S6.next = S3.next
4. S7.next = S3.next
5. S8.next = E1.false
