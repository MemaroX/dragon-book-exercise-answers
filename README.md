### Foreword

This project contains my personal answers to the exercises in the book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" (2nd Edition), also known as the Dragon Book.

The answers are written in markdown format. For questions that require coding, they are completed in Java.

The project is still ongoing.
